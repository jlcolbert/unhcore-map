| How to Use              | Describe the resource, such as what it is about and/or what it is, whichever is appropriate.<br/>Description should apply to the object being described, not to a collection to which it belongs. |
| Best Practices          | Remember that users will be seeing this description outside of its context, so avoid abbreviations and ambiguous references.                                                                      |
| Examples                | Manâ€™s vest of brown velveteen, machine-embroidered with pink flowers and green leaves.                                                                                                            |
