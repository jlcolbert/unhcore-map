| Syntax/Formatting       | Separate subjects with commas. All nouns should be plural. Use sentence case except for proper nouns.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Controlled Vocabularies | A controlled vocabulary such as AAT, LCSH, Homosaurus, or others as appropriate. For names and geographic locations, use name authority vocabularies. LCSH and other LoC vocabularies are preferred because of the Primo VE Discovery environment, but AAT and other Getty vocabularies in addition are recommended, especially for art. |
| How to Use              | Assign subjects based on what the resource is _about_, not what it _is_.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Best Practices          | Split subdivided headings into individual headings with commas. If the subdivision is a genre or format, remove the subdivision and place in genre or medium as appropriate.                                                                                                                                                             |
| Examples                | Acworth (N.H. : Town) -- Appropriations and expenditures would turn into Acworth (N.H. : Town), Appropriates and expenditures<br/>Operas -- Scores would turn into Operas.                                                                                                                                                               |
