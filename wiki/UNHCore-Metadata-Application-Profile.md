# UNHCore Metadata Application Profile

## Version 2 (2021)

## Introduction

In planning the future of metadata for the UNH library in anticipation of a system migration, the UNHCore Property Set was changed from the DCMI Terms List (which had been used for the eventual support of a linked data environment) to the original Dublin Core Metadata Element Set. This allows for the temporary migration to Digital Commons, the system currently used for our Scholars' Repository.

The UNHCore requirements are designed to identify the properties necessary for a user in a shared metadata environment to gain a basic understanding of a metadata record and what it describes. They are not format-specific, but rather identify those properties commonly needed across all formats. The names of properties used here are not prescriptive, but have been generalized to indicate the broadest meaning of the property that is necessary to encompass a variety of formats.<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> These guidelines are not intended to be a replacement for format- or project-specific metadata best practices within the UNH Library. It is likely that specific formats will require more robust metadata than that outlined here. Individual projects and units that are creating metadata should contact the Metadata Librarian (Jay L. Colbert) to discuss needs, as additional customization in the system is possible.

The organic environment of metadata continues to evolve and the standards and best practices outlined here may evolve along with it. Additions, changes and deletions to this document will be recorded in the version control table for the UNHCore.
