| Notes                   | Use for translations, transliterations, shorter, uniform title, or commonly-known titles. All titles should be in Title Case. Separate multiple alternative titles with semicolons.                                                                                                                                                       |
| Examples                | If the title of a score is _Le Nozze di Figaro,_ an alternative title could be _The Marriage of Figaro._ Alternatively, if the title of the score is _The Marriage of Figaro,_ you could put _Le Nozze di Figaro_ as an alternative title. For both, you could put the uniform title as an alternative title, which is _Nozze di Figaro._ |
