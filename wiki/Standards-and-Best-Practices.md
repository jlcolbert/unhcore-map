## Standards and Best Practices

The General Best Practices section provides an introduction to basic metadata concepts, and is organized by different types of metadata standards. The standards included are vetted standards and other standards may be included as needed, provided that they go through a formal Decision Process.

### General Best Practices

When standards are used for metadata they enable data sharing and interoperability among different systems. Standards, best practices, and documentation will play an even greater role for library metadata as open access, linked data and the Semantic Web become more integrated with library practices. Four types of standards used for metadata are discussed below.

- Content Standards
- Data Value Standards
- Structural Standards
- Syntax Standards

#### Content Standards for Metadata

**Content standards** explain what information should be recorded when describing a particular type of resource and how that information should be recorded. Paired with structural standards for metadata, content standards improve the ability to share metadata records and the discoverability of resources. When similar resources are described consistently across metadata records, users are better able to understand and analyze search results. Metadata that is formatted inconsistently (ex. names recorded both as “Last name, First name” and “First name / Last name;” terms abbreviated or spelled out) impacts indexing and sorting, and users bear the burden of having to decipher confusing or incomplete results.
The choice of which content standard should be decided based on the type of resources that will be described in the collection and the intended audience for the materials, and may be influenced by the structural standard being used.

##### List of Content Standards

- _Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO),_ a data content standard published by ALA, was written mostly by Visual Resource Curators for the cultural heritage community. It serves a similar purpose as RDA, but with special treatment for cultural objects like works of art, architecture, and artifacts.
- _Describing Archives: A Content Standard (DACS)_ is a content standard designed for single- and multi-level descriptions of archives, personal papers, and manuscripts, and can be applied to all material types.
- _Resource Description and Access (RDA)_ is the current cataloging content standard. Selecting metadata properties according to RDA creates metadata for digital collections that are more readily interoperable with the library catalog bibliographic data.

#### Data Value Standards

**Data Value Standards** provide a normalized list of terms to be used for certain data elements. Using controlled terms ensures consistency between records and allows for collocation of resources related to the same topic or person. This is done through the use of thesauri, controlled vocabularies, and authority files. Data value standards are indicated for each UNHCore property where applicable.

##### List of Data Value Standards

- The AFS [American Folklore Society Ethnographic Thesaurus](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/ethnographicTerms.html) (version 2.3) is a vocabulary that can be used to improve access to information about folklore, ethnomusicology, ethnology, and related fields. The American Folklore Society developed the Thesaurus in cooperation with the American Folklife Center of the Library of Congress and supported by a generous grant from the Scholarly Communications Program of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation.
- The [DCMI Type Vocabulary (DCMIType)](http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/) provides a general, cross-domain list of approved terms that may be used as values for the Resource Type property to identify the genre of a resource.
- [DPLA Geographic and Temporal Guidelines for MAP 3.1](http://bit.ly/dpla-geo-styleguide-3_1): Recommendations for the formatting of geographic and temporal data in records that will be shared with DPLA.
- [DPLA Metadata Quality Guidelines](http://bit.ly/dpla-metadata-qual): Best practices for creating shareable metadata for the DPLA aggregation. Each property in the DPLA Metadata Application Profile is reviewed with tiered recommendations for minimal, improved, and best quality.
- [DPLA Standardized Rights Statements Implementation Guidelines](http://bit.ly/dpla-rights-guidelines): A description of DPLA’s implementation of standardized rights statements and recommendations for the use of statements in records that will be shared with DPLA.
- [Getty Art and Architecture Thesauri (AAT)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/aat/) is a structured vocabulary for terms used to describe art, architecture, decorative arts, material culture, and archival materials.
- [Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/tgn/index.html) is a structured vocabulary for names and other information about places.
- [Getty Union List of Artist Names (ULAN)](http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies/ulan/index.html) is a structured vocabulary for names and other information about artists.
- [Glossary of Disability Terminology](https://www.dpa.org.sg/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/DPA-Disability-Glossary-FINAL.pdf)
- [The Homosaurus](http://homosaurus.org)<sup id="a1">[1](#f1)</sup> is an international linked data vocabulary of LGBTQ terms that supports improved access to LGBTQ resources within cultural institutions. Designed to serve as a companion to broad subject term vocabularies, the Homosaurus is a robust and cutting-edge vocabulary of LGBTQ-specific terminology that enhances the discoverability of LGBTQ resources.
- [Internet Media Types (IMT—formerly known as MIME).](https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml) MIME types were originally created for emails sent using the SMTP protocol. Nowadays, this standard is used in a lot of other protocols, hence the new naming convention "Internet Media Type". See Appendix A for a list of Media Types.
- The [Library of Congress Genre/Form Terms](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/genreForms.html) for Library and Archival Materials (LCGFT) is a thesaurus that describes what a work is versus what it is about. For instance, the subject heading Horror films, with appropriate subdivisions, would be assigned to a book about horror films. A cataloger assigning headings to the movie The Texas Chainsaw Massacre would also use Horror films, but it would be a genre/form term since the movie is a horror film, not a movie about horror films. The thesaurus combines both genres and forms. Form is defined as a characteristic of works with a particular format and/or purpose. A "short" is a particular form, for example, as is "animation." Genre refers to categories of works that are characterized by similar plots, themes, settings, situations, and characters. Examples of genres are westerns and thrillers. In the term Horror films "horror" is the genre and "films" is the form.
- [Library of Congress Subject Headings (LCSH)](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/subjects.html) comprises a thesaurus of subject headings, maintained by the United States Library of Congress.
- [Library of Congress Name Authority File (LCNAF)](https://id.loc.gov/authorities/names.html) includes Corporate Names, Geographic Names, Conference Names and Personal Names.
- The [_OLAC video game genre vocabulary_](http://www.olacinc.org/olac-video-game-vocabulary) includes sixty-six genre terms, each with a scope note to help librarians choose the correct term when cataloging video games.
- [Queer LCSH](http://www.netanelganin.com/projects/QueerLCSH/QueerLCSH.html) is a project by Netanel Ganin which curates all Library of Congress Subject Headings relating to queer people.
- The [Thesaurus of Graphic Materials](https://id.loc.gov/vocabulary/graphicMaterials.html) is a tool for indexing visual materials by subject and by genre/format. The thesaurus includes more than 7,000 subject terms and 650 genre/format terms to index types of photographs, prints, design drawings, ephemera, and other pictures.
- [Virtual International Authority File (VIAF)](http://viaf.org) combines multiple name authority files into a single name authority service. The goal of the service is to lower the cost and increase the utility of library authority files by matching and linking widely-used authority files and making that information available on the Web.
- [The Women’s Thesaurus](https://institute-genderequality.org/library-archive/thesaurus/) is a useful tool for searching by subject. It consists of terms about women, gender, gender equality and feminism. It also includes synonyms along with broader, more specific and related terms. The thesaurus is a good starting point for searches involving theses, research, articles, programs and policy memoranda.

#### Structural Standards for Metadata

**Metadata structure** includes the properties (aka fields or elements) where the data resides. Structural standards (i.e., metadata schemes) define the properties and the types of information that should be recorded in them. Since the UNHCore is based on the Dublin Core it is designed to be a structural standard with a lower level of granularity in order to accommodate most types of digital objects. When a higher level of granularity (i.e., more detail) is needed for a particular object or collection, properties may be added to the UNHCore and documented with an application profile. Sometimes the structural standards mandate what syntax standards should be used.

##### General Points

- Properties should be unambiguous.
- Some properties may be required.
- Some properties may be repeatable.
- Some properties may require a unique value, different from any other record in the system.
- Some properties may have defined relationships with other properties.

##### List of Structural Standards

- Dublin Core (DC) is the most widely used metadata standard to provide a basic level of description for interoperability at a low level of granularity. The UNHCore uses the original Dublin Core Metadata Element Set.

#### Syntax Standards

**Syntax standards** are used as the framework for the structural standards, supporting the exchange and sharing of data among different databases.

##### List of Syntax Standards

- Extensible Markup Language (XML) Extensible Markup Language is a simple, very flexible text format. Originally designed to meet the challenges of large-scale electronic publishing, XML is also playing an increasingly important role in the exchange of a wide variety of data on the Web.
- Resource Description Format (RDF) RDF is a standard model for data interchange on the Web. RDF has features that facilitate data merging even if the underlying schemas differ, and it specifically supports the evolution of schemas over time without requiring all the data consumers to be changed.
