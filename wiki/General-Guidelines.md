## General Guidelines

The UNHCore Metadata Property Set consists of 27 descriptive elements. However, it is a living set and is subject to change according to need. Properties are either required, recommended, or optional. UNHCore has 10 required (if available) properties, 4 recommended properties, and 10 optional properties. There are also 3 additional required (if available) properties for serials.

### Relevant Namespaces

Namespaces are prefixes to metadata properties that indicate the scheme from which it is being used. Namespaces prevent confusion about properties that may be used in more than one schema. The UNHCore MAP references properties using the following namespaces:

dc: http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/
dcterms: http://purl.org/dc/terms/
dcmitype: http://purl.org/dc/dcmitype/

### Describing Objects

Despite its various standards, metadata creation is not an exact science. Although some properties have little to no ambiguity—such as file format—others leave much room for interpretation and variety. _Sometimes, judgments will have to be made on a case-by-case basis, describing and classifying resources in particular;_ the subject headings one person assigns for a resource might be different than those assigned by another. The creation of metadata requires interpretation, and therefore is highly subjective and political.

No decision made in metadata creation is a neutral act.

Whenever possible, use the language and phrasing the resource provides. For resources without text, do not over-interpret visual cues or coding relating to identity. _When in doubt, consistency is more important than textbook accuracy._ For collections, create templates to include unique rules/exceptions. If you are unsure how to describe or title an object, please consult Jay L. Colbert and Sarah Stinson for historical precedent, industry standards, and emerging trends.

#### Statement on Potentially Harmful Language in Object Description

The nature of language is that it naturally changes and evolves over time. This includes language used for identities, communities, acts, affects, ethnicities, and other such realms. In the case of marginalized peoples and related subjects, the language used for them by those in power is often harmful, as it does not come from the marginalized themselves. Preferred language that was not harmful at the time might be harmful to current sensibilities. And within marginalized groups, terminology can be a site of debate and discourse.

This poses unique challenges for description and classification in library collections. Controlled vocabularies, such as the Library of Congress Subject Headings, typically follow literary warrant, meaning that they create terms when the need arises for them, and the wording used for the terms depends on the context of the need. Controlled vocabularies are also slow to change. However, their use is crucial. Controlled vocabularies allow researchers to navigate collections by subject and find related resources. Controlled vocabularies also (in theory) remove ambiguity: the Library of Congress Subject Heading "Segregation" means a specific thing, and every resource that uses it uses it with that context.

Therefore, UNHCore uses multiple controlled vocabularies when possible and/or creates local keywords. This practice allows for the type of categorization needed for research while also giving space to historical terminology and current preferred/alternative terminology. Because we import these collections into our Primo VE discovery environment, we privilege Library of Congress authorities to provide consistency (unless otherwise stated). When adding additional vocabularies, list the preferred term before any harmful language. Finally, make a note about the language in the Comments field. A list of alternative vocabularies is in the Best Practices and Guidelines portion of this Metadata Application Profile.
