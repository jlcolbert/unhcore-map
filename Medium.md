| Syntax/Formatting       | Nouns should be pluralized and verbs should be in -ing form. Use sentence case except for proper nouns. Separate multiple terms with commas.                                                                                            |
| Controlled Vocabularies | Controlled vocabularies such as AAT and LCGFT. Standards from the Library of Congress are preferred due to the Primo VE discovery environment.<br/>If medium/genre vocabularies are not sufficient, use subject vocabularies like LCSH. |
| How to Use              | Assign the resource a heading that represents the format of the physical resource itself, not the file format.<br/>Also use this property to describe the genre of a resource.                                                          |
| Best Practices          | When picking a vocabulary, use the one that is most appropriate for the collection. Town reports might use LCGFT/LCSH, whereas a photograph collection might use AAT.                                                                   |
| Examples                | battlefield maps, annual reports, bound sheet music                                                                                                                                                                                     |
